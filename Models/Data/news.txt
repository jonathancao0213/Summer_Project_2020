1|(Bloomberg) -- A disconnect is growing in emerging markets, which have rarely faced such dire economic conditions and yet whose assets are about to round out their best quarter in a decade.The MSCI Emerging Markets Index as well as dollar bonds are on track to post their biggest quarterly gains since the 2009 recovery from the global financial crisis. The tidal wave of central-bank stimulus sweeping the world has supported risk appetite.Emerging-market currencies are up about 2% in the past three months, with the Indonesian rupiah, Russian ruble and Colombian peso leading gains. Capital flows are showing a �modest return� after outflows in early 2020 dwarfed those of prior crises, according to a June 24 report from Institute of International Finance.All of that is at odds with the downbeat outlook, especially for Latin American, South Asian and African economies, where virus outbreaks risk spiraling out of control. The IMF�s latest projections show that while China could eke out growth this year, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and South Africa have each been marked down to a contraction of 8% or greater.The yawning divide between market gains and economic gloom risks a snapback in the months ahead that would add to recovery headwinds.�While the ample liquidity and the low-rate environment continues to provide EMs with the lure of high coupons, as the recovery process gets delayed, I think the risk considerations are worsening for emerging markets as a class,� Carmen Reinhart, the World Bank�s chief economist, said at last week�s Bloomberg Invest Global conference.The World Bank is predicting emerging and developing nations as a group will shrink 2.5% -- their worst performance in data that starts in 1960. The economic pain could catch some more bullish investors wrong-footed.�I expect a day of reckoning is coming where foreign investors will conclude that they are not getting compensated for the risks in EM countries,� said Rob Subbaraman, global head of macro research at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Singapore.Bloomberg Economics sees lost output in emerging markets equating to the size of Russia�s economy. Ziad Daoud, Dubai-based chief emerging markets economist, says instead of offering risky returns, they are increasingly offering return-free risks.What Bloomberg�s Economists Say�For emerging markets, the virus recession starts with a pandemic most are ill-equipped to deal with, then layers on the worst elements of the 2008 global demand shock, the 2014 collapse in commodity prices, and the 2018 capital flight episode.�Daoud estimates that even a best-case scenario will mean losses that equate to the size of Turkey�s economy, and that would require a lot to go right: �the virus receding, a recovery in advanced economies boosting exports, financial flows and commodity demand, and sizable EM stimulus.�Click here to read the full report.Central banks in the emerging-market world have joined their developed peers in slashing interest rates and Bloomberg Economics counts 13 as of late April that have implemented or are considering buying government bonds. More experiments with unconventional measures risk spurring capital outflows.It�s not uniformly disastrous for emerging markets. Jim O�Neill, chair of Chatham House, is downbeat on Latin America and India, but he told Bloomberg Television that he sees a chance �this crisis might accelerate this century of Asian dominance� as China and other economies in the region prove adept at managing the pandemic.Subbaraman called Asia the �least ugly region� among emerging markets.Edwin Gutierrez, the London-based head of emerging-market sovereign debt at Aberdeen Asset Management, said he sees the �low-lying fruit� as already picked. He now sees a real risk that some countries in South Asia and Latin America will have to pause lockdown relaxations.Spreads on emerging-market bonds are unlikely to return to the levels seen in January, with the economies of Brazil, Mexico and Peru likely to be among the hardest hit by the virus, said Todd Schubert, Singapore-based head of fixed-income research at Bank of Singapore Ltd.Defaults in developing economies will probably increase to 4% to 5% at the end of the year, from 1% to 2% in 2019, Schubert said.�We would compare the incipient rally in emerging-market spreads to a teenager with a new sports car,� Schubert said. �You know the power and potential are there but you are wary of the dangers as well.�Emerging-market assets might still have a �good� second half of 2020, though it�ll be hard to repeat the gains thus far, said Eric Stein, Boston-based co-director of global fixed income at Eaton Vance Corp., which manages about $465 billion. Stein flagged countries like Brazil as highly risky given that further monetary policy easing could mean �disorderly� outflows.He favors Ukrainian local-debt assets, Romanian external sovereign credit, and Vietnamese equities.Emerging markets that have poured on the fiscal stimulus -- now around $11 trillion for all governments globally, the IMF estimates -- have less room to spend without triggering concerns over unmanageable debt. And many of their central banks are at record-low interest rates already and therefore have less room to act if their economies continue to crater.�I think EMs are going to be in a very tough spot going forward,� said Reinhart.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.�2020 Bloomberg L.P.

1|(Bloomberg) -- The coming week looks set to encapsulate the bipolar nature of emerging markets as effectively as any this year.The rising wave of Covid-19 infections, notably in India, Indonesia and Brazil but most worryingly in the U.S., continues to create nervousness about how quickly developing economies can reopen. Expected market swings aren�t receding as much as they are for developed countries. In fact, the gap between implied volatility in emerging-market currencies and their Group-of-Seven peers is at the widest in almost four weeks.Yet, the fountain of liquidity provided by the world�s leading central banks is helping to sustain a contrary narrative -- that an economic rebound isn�t far off. A gauge of developing-nation currencies is on course for its best month this year, stocks as measured by the MSCI Inc. index have climbed in June by more than 7%, and both domestic and dollar bonds are in the green.�Emerging-market debt, by and large, can sustain the rebound given the unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy actions by the major economies, barring a second wave larger than the first one for Covid-19,� said Jens Nystedt, a New York-based money manager at Emso Asset Management, which oversees $5.5 billion.�Large real interest-rate differentials will allow emerging markets to attract portfolio inflows among the better-quality names� he said.China�s Proposed LawA tense holiday on Wednesday marking 23 years of Chinese rule in Hong Kong could spark local protests and aggravate U.S.-China tensionsChina�s top legislative body will vote on Hong Kong�s security legislation Tuesday morning, the day before the city�s handover anniversary.

1|(Bloomberg) -- Jerome Powell likes to point out how the Federal Reserve�s run-it-hot policy to prolong growth helped low-income Americans get jobs and pay raises.But after those gains were blown away by the coronavirus, the Fed chair�s zero-rates rescue is falling short of helping the most vulnerable in the labor market. Instead, it may end up widening inequalities.New research by Fed economists shows how badly the pandemic-era job losses skewed against the poor, who got laid off at four times the pace of higher earners. Women and minorities were hit especially hard, Labor Department data shows.�The pandemic exposed just how fragile the labor market was,� said Valerie Grant, a senior fund manager for AllianceBernstein�s Responsible U. S Equities portfolios. While the Fed�s focus on addressing labor inequalities is �laudable,� she said, �I don�t know that it will prompt real change. There are limits to what monetary policy alone can do.�Buck StopsPowell himself is making that point with growing urgency as inequalities widen.While labor faces a long grind to regain its pre-crisis footing, capital markets have come roaring back �- largely thanks to the multi-trillion-dollar rescue that the Fed helped orchestrate.By the end of May, employment among the lowest-paid one-fifth of Americans was still about 30% below February levels, according to a paper co-authored by Fed economists this month. By that point, U.S. stocks -� whose ownership skews toward the wealthy and white -� had recouped most of their losses and were down about 10% from the year�s highs.Powell and his colleagues strongly deny that their policies are exacerbating inequality. They say they�ll do everything in their power to get America back to the hot jobs market of 2019 -� including by keeping interest rates near zero for the foreseeable future.But the Fed chief is bluntly telling officials in charge of U.S. government spending that in the fight to avert a depression, the buck largely stops with them.On Tuesday, Powell is due to testify jointly with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Congress, where lawmakers are debating whether to add to the $3 trillion of pandemic-stimulus they�ve approved -- or start dialing it back.�Long Road Back�All over the world, governments are turning to fiscal policy to pull their economies out of the worst slump in generations, amid a growing consensus that monetary policy -- the central tool of economic management for several decades -- is running out of road.In America, �for the lesser skilled and educated, it�s going to be a long, long road back,� said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody�s Analytics. �The Fed can only take us part of the way.�Full recovery in employment will likely require policies such as wider provision of childcare and training, and job-creating investments in infrastructure, Zandi said. �It�s going to take a lot of federal and state and local government support to get us back, even with the Fed�s foot flat on the accelerator.�Around 20 million Americans remain unemployed, data published Thursday showed. The jobless rate for Black Americans, which hit a record low of 5.4% last year, stood at 16.8% in May. Nearly one out of every five Hispanic women is out of a job.Such numbers, at a time when unrest spurred by racial and economic injustice is already gripping the nation, risk fanning the flames. And the latest virus reports, showing a resurgence of cases across the country as the economy reopened, has set back hopes of a relatively swift rebound.Prior to the pandemic, Powell had been able to point to the benefits of running a tight or hot labor market, with the lowest jobless levels in 50 years helping to erode inequalities. In Congressional testimony this month, he warned that the current slump could have the opposite effect.�If not contained and reversed, the downturn could further widen gaps in economic well-being,� he said.Red LinesThe central bank crossed its own �red lines� during the rescue efforts, by buying junk-rated debt and lending to local governments. The Fed cut its benchmark interest rate to zero, and it�s �not even thinking about thinking about� raising it, according to Powell.Congress has played its part, with fiscal steps including grants to help small businesses and beefed-up unemployment benefits. Now some Republicans are reluctant to extend the measures as they gradually expire in the second half of 2020.�It would be a concern if Congress were to pull back from the support that it�s providing too quickly,� Powell told the House panel. He drew a swift rebuke from the panel�s ranking Republican, who said that fiscal policy is Congress�s business not the Fed�s.�More Helpful�Since early in his term, Powell has shown an interest in pushing the Fed�s monetary policy as far as it can go in the direction of maximum employment, which it�s legally mandated to deliver -- and questioning whether it�s gone about that task the right way in the past.At a hearing in July 2019, Powell agreed with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a standard-bearer for the progressive left, that the Fed was wrong about its previous estimates of full employment. One consequence of that is central bankers raised rates too fast before letting the economy�s engine of job-creation spread gains through minority communities.The problem is that such insights, about how a high-pressure economy can reduce inequality, likely won�t be applicable for quite a while. At least, not by central bankers.�Monetary policy could be reaching its limits,� said John Briggs, head of strategy for the Americas at NatWest Markets.�The central bank can support the fiscal side, which is what they have been doing,� he said. �But directly putting the money into consumers� pockets -- or extending the unemployment benefits -- will be a lot more helpful. As opposed to whether the Fed buys $10 billion or $100 billion of corporate bonds.�For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.�2020 Bloomberg L.P.
1|(Bloomberg) -- Perhaps the most challenging riddle for investors in the pandemic is whether another centuries-old scourge is going to return.Inflation can wreck even the safest portfolio by eroding the value of investments for decades. But you would be hard pressed to find anyone among�the younger generation of investors, within developed markets at least, who has faced it in any meaningful way. The last major episode was back in the 1970s and �80s, and inflation has all but disappeared since the 2008 financial crisis.But the pandemic has changed the world so dramatically that Wall Street�s heavyweights from Pacific Investment Management Co. to AllianceBernstein Holding LP say it�s a problem that�s�bound to return.Not everyone agrees. Some argue deflation is just as likely, and others like UBS Wealth Management are positioning for softer price increases, a scenario known as lowflation.��It is the billion dollar question,� says�Christoph Rieger, head of fixed-rate strategy at Commerzbank AG.The mainstream view is that central banks can rescue their economies now without destabilizing prices in the future. Bonds, the assets most vulnerable to inflation, have surged and the breakeven rate, which gauges market expectations for future price rises, languishes below central bank targets across developed markets. In the euro area, inflation isn�t expected to reach the European Central Bank�s close to 2% target for 30 years.�The largest investment risk is if investors get it wrong and we are heading for deflation,� Rieger said. �We could be entering a financial crisis like we�ve never seen before.�With governments paying wages, handing out loans�and mailing out checks, there�s now an unprecedented amount of new cash in the financial system. Put simply, there�s more money available to potentially chase fewer goods, a textbook definition for why prices rise.But there are lots of reasons why that scenario may not play out. Companies and consumers could stash the�extra cash in bank accounts, rather than spend�it.�If you look at what you have now compared to what you had in the past, you have larger triggers that would point to higher inflation. But it�s not that simple,� said Lorenzo Pagani, Pimco�s head of European government bond portfolio management. �If you look at almost 100 years of inflation numbers, you have many more days with higher inflation compared to now.�Japan is a prime example of why stimulus spending doesn�t necessarily drive inflation. The country�poured money�into its economy for a generation to little or no avail at getting prices�to budge. It�s sucked the life out of markets in the process and the country has been�forced to battle�permanently weak�growth as the population ages.�What Bloomberg Intelligence says:�There is a long memory of low inflation and markets aren�t pricing in a regime change. The lesson from Japan is to remain highly skeptical. Inflation uncertainty may be hedged through long-dated options.�\-- Tanvir Sandhu, Chief Global Derivatives StrategistAt the opposite end of the spectrum lurks an equally, if not more worrying scenario: deflation. If people emerge from the pandemic less willing to spend, either because they�re unemployed or simply thriftier now that they�ve figured out how to cut their own hair, cook at home and exercise in the backyard, prices for goods and services could fall. That can drag wages lower in a self-reinforcing spiral that leads to depression, as it did in the 1930s.One of the main conundrums for investors: Is the coronavirus more of a shock to demand because people are spending less, or to supply from factories shutting down? Nouriel Roubini, a professor of economics at New York University, says in the worst-case scenario the current crisis could lead to a particularly toxic mix harking back to the 1970s. Known as �stagflation,� it�s a period of high inflation, but weak economic output.�We are going to be facing now a significant amount of supply shocks in the global economy,� he said. �Eventually the inflation genie is going to get out of the bottle.�AllianceBernstein is positioning for a reflationary resurgence through U.S. inflation-linked bonds, known as TIPS. John Taylor, who manages $6.6 billion at the�investment firm in London, says the pandemic will be a wake-up call for countries to move manufacturing of essential products back home.�One of the consequences of Covid will be less of a drive to push for the cheapest venue for production, but to have more of that production within your own borders, which will be a higher cost,� said Taylor. He�s not the only one making that call. Assets in the Schwab US TIPS exchange-traded fund have risen above $10 billion, the highest level in at least a year.UBS Wealth Management doesn�t see value in U.S. inflation-linked bonds, preferring�equities on the belief that there�s stronger growth ahead.�Paul Donovan, global chief economist at UBS, says that 85% of people in the U.K. haven�t seen any drop in income, but are spending less anyway. That means when purchases pick up, inflation could happen in�pockets of the economy, like consumer staples.��Whenever we have a crisis like this, people always underestimate the ability of people to adapt and therefore underestimate the speed of the recovery,� he said on a call with reporters. �The third-quarter growth in the U.K., in Europe and in the U.S. will be the best quarter ever in history, almost certainly.�Governments also have an incentive to spur price�rises, given the huge buildup of debt. In the U.K., borrowing has climbed above gross domestic product for the first time since 1963. In the U.S., it�s approaching records set after World War II.�Governments will have no option but to turn to the printing presses and directly fund deficits,� wrote Keith Wade, chief economist at Schroder Investment Management Ltd. �Those looking for higher inflation to solve debt problems should be careful what they wish for.�For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.�2020 Bloomberg L.P.
